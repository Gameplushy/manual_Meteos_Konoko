# Meteos Manual for Archipelago Randomizer
This repo implements a manual implementation of Meteos for Archipelago Randomizer (AP).

## How it works
Every planet is an item. You start with 4 of them.
Locations are checked my winning a random match as a planet.
There are also 20 additional locations that specify a specific planet to beat (both planets are expected to be unlocked for the location to be in logic)
You'll start the game playing with 5 star AI Level and 5 star difficulty. There are 4 "Progressive AI Lobotomy" and 4 "Progressive Difficulty Lobotomy" to lower the difficulty of each parameter, one of each should be obtained easily.

Finally, there are 3 "Meteo Boss Shard", which are your McGuffins to unlock the final location, "Win vs 3 Meteos" (also expects you to have all planets unlocked to be in logic).
